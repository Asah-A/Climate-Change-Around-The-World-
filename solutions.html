                    <h2>Have a Plant Rich Diet</h2>
                        <p>
                            Scientists project that if animals products are consumed at such a high rate, the situation will be worse yet with greenhouse gas emissions up by 80 percent by 2050.
                            If the world were to adopt variations on three common diets, <i>Mediterranean</i>, <i>vegetarian</i> and <i>pescatarian</i> our health would be greatly increased. At the same time global greenhouse gas emissions would be reduced by an amount equal to the current greenhouse gas emissions of all cars, trucks, planes, trains and ships. In addition, this dietary shift would prevent the destruction of an area of tropical forests and savannahs as large as half of the <i>US</i>. Plant-based can support healthy living at every age. It includes <em>not only fruits and vegetables</em>, but also nuts, seeds, oils, whole grains, legumes, and beans. It doesn’t mean that you are <em>vegetarian or vegan</em> and never eat meat or dairy. Rather, you are choosing more of your food sources from plants</p>

                    <h2>Plant More Trees</h2>
                        <p>
                        Want to fight climate change? Just plant more trees, for starters.
                        A new study offers hope for the world: A group of researchers based in <i>Switzerland</i>, <i>Italy</i>, and <i>France</i> found that expanding forests, which take in carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and release oxygen, could seriously make up for humans’ toxic carbon emissions. According to the <i>United Nations Intergovernmental Panel</i> on Climate Change, reported on the Bulletin “the world’s foremost authority on climate, estimated that we’d need to plant 1 billion hectares of forest by 2050 to keep the globe from warming a full 1.5 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels. (One hectare is about 2.4 acres, or twice the size of a football field.) Not only is that “undoubtedly achievable,” according to the study’s authors, but global tree restoration is “our most effective climate change solution to date.”

                    <h2><strong>Don't Listen to Trump</strong></h2>
                    <p>
                    <strong>DON’T LISTEN TO TRUMP!</strong>
                    <i>Trumps</i> exact Twitter tweet states that “the concept of global warming was created by and for the <i>Chinese</i> in order to make <i>U.S.</i> manufacturing more non-competitive”. In a tweet in 2013, he called global warming an “expensive hoax” that should not be focused on. Now with all the scientific evidence to back up that climate change is real, how can people still believe that it is a hoax?. You must be living in a dream if you were to think this.

                    <h2>Stop buying what you want, focus on your needs</h2>
                    <p>
                    I will simply put it to you this way, you <strong>don’t need all the luxury and expensive items in the world to live a satisfied life</strong>. Buy <b>less stuff</b> and save the planet. It is as simple as that. <b>Reduce , re-use and recycle</b>. They are the magic three words in life. Be an informed citizen and conscious of your actions to the environment with fashion. Buy high quality items that will last a couple of years instead of buying fast fashion trends. Donate clothes to charity shops so that others can purchase and use them again. Send your unwanted items to other countries by your local charity organizations like <i>Oxfam</i>.

                    <h2>Reduce, Reuse, Recylce</h2>
                    <p>
                        As per <i>Missouri Department of Natural Resources</i>,
                        “The three R’s – reduce, reuse and recycle – all help to cut down on the amount of waste we throw away. They conserve natural resources, landfill space and energy. Plus, the three R’s save land and money communities must use to dispose of waste in landfills. Siting a new landfill has become difficult and more expensive due to environmental regulations and public opposition.” Refuse to buy items that you don’t need, re-use items more than once and dispose of the items that are no longer in use at appropriate recycling centres, which will contribute towards a healthier planet.

                    <h2>Choose Renewable Energy</h2>
                    <p>
                    <i>Renewable energy</i> could supply four-fifths of the world’s electricity by 2050, massively cutting carbon emissions and helping to change the course climate change. Renewable energy uses energy sources that are not "used up". There are <b>many types of renewable energy</b> such as wind, solar, ocean, biomass energies etc. Examples of <i>non-renewable energy</i> sources include fossil fuels like coal and oil. Once we use or burn these resources, they are <b>gone forever</b>. A single large wind turbine used instead of burning coal can prevent the emission of 5000 tons of carbon dioxide each year. In some areas you can generate your own renewable energy, like with a solar cell or wind turbine, and then sell it back to the local energy company.  Use public transport as much as possible since it reduces the amount of fuel consumed, as fuel is created from crude oil which is a fossil fuel.</p>
