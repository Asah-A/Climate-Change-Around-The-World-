                    <h2>The Greenhouse Effect</h2>
                    <p>The <b>greenhouse effect</b> is explained in the name itself! The earth is surrounded by a
                        bubble!
                        <em>Not a real bubble but a gas bubble</em> .
                        <strong>You don't need to be worried about the name of this layer</strong>. But for the
                        nerds out there, it is called the <b>OZONE LAYER</b>.
                        When the sun shines onto the earth, the heat from the sun is trapped inside this layer.
                        The earth’s atmosphere has always acted like a greenhouse to capture the sun’s heat, ensuring
                        that the earth has been warm enough for the new emergence of life forms including humans.
                        So lets answer an important question! What is <b>global warming</b>? We'll simply put it,
                        <b>global
                            warming is the slow increase in the average temperature of the earth’s atmosphere because
                            of an increased amount of heat remaining in the ozone laye</b>r.Without the greenhouse
                        effect the
                        earth would be very cold. Global warming, however, is the
                        equivalent of an actual greenhouse with high efficiency glass placed the wrong side up. Weird,
                        right?
                        This causes excess heat to be trapped in the earth causing <strong>major changes</strong> to the
                        earths climate.

                    <h2>Burning Fossil Fuels</h2>
                    <p>So what causes global warming? One major factor is the burning of <b>fossil fuels</b>.
                        According to wikepedia "fossil fuels are a fuel formed by natural processes,
                        such as anaerobic decomposition of buried dead organisms, containing energy originating in
                        ancient photosynthesis. Such organisms and their resulting fossil fuels typically have an age of
                        millions of years, and sometimes more than 650 million years". Burning these fuels causes an
                        <strong>increase
                            in the amount of carbon dioxide gas in the atmosphere</strong>. This gas likes to trap the
                        suns heat even more, further
                        warming the planet leading to the greenhouse effect and ultimately causing a major role in
                        global warming! Intersting right?</p>

                    <h2>Deforestation</h2>
                    <p><b>Deforestation</b>is the chopping down trees in large amounts.<strong>It is the second leading
                            cause of global warming, first being the burning of fossil fuels causing excess greenhouse
                            gases.Deforestation produces about 24&percnt; of global greenhouse gas emissions
                            The earth is covered by 31&percnt; of forests</strong>.That is alot of forest. The <i>Amazon
                            Rainforest</i> is the largest forest in the world. Scientist say that deforestation in
                        rainforests adds more <i>CO2</i> to the atmosphere than the total sum of all the
                        cars and trucks on the world’s roads. In countries, like <i>Brazil</i> and <i>Indonesia</i>,
                        deforestation is by far the main source of greenhouse.
                        gas emissions.The livelihoods of 1.6 billion people depend on forests.Forests are home to
                        80&percnt; of the world’s wildlife according to the <i>International Union of Concerned
                            Scientists</i>.The forests are cut down for food, space for cattle farming to feed the meat
                        eaters on this planet. Also for timber to build homes etc. to cater for humans growing needs for
                        food and space.</p>

                    <h2>Fast Fashion</h2>
                    <p><b>Fast fashion</b> according to wikipedia is "a contemporary term used by fashion
                        retailers for designs that move from catwalk quickly to capture current fashion trends. A
                        second, critical definition adds that fast fashion is not only about quickly moving from runway
                        to store to consumer, but also to the garbage" Right now the pricing of clothes is extremely
                        cheap so people
                        are able to buy new clothing extremely fast and replcae them even faster.It has become the norm
                        in first world countries.
                        <strong>Cheap labour</strong>is carried out in the third world, where work conditions are
                        extreme and workers work excessively long hours just to get paid less then minimun wage per
                        month.
                        This is called <b>sweatshop</b> conditions. Large fashion retailers are able to make clothes
                        with cheap labour and sell them to make huge profit margins. RTE says
                        "it used to take six months to bring new designs to the store, but the fast fashion brands
                        manage
                        to bring interpretations of catwalk designs to stores today in a minimum of two to three weeks."
                        Aswell as being a violoation
                        of human rights, ast fashion includes its negative environmental impact, water pollution,
                        the use of toxic chemicals and increasing levels of textile waste.The fast fashion industries
                        account for approximately 8% of the world's
                        greenhouse gas emissions. </p>

                    <h2>Meat and Dairy</h2>
                    <p><strong>Warning, this may trigger the meat eaters reading this piece!</strong> Guess what? A
                        mostly plant-based diet
                        can actually help save the environment and reduce the effects of climate change! To create those
                        hearty meaty meals , forests are cut down, harmful
                        pesticides are used and the poor animals have to die.<i>BBC</i> says "A major report on land use
                        and climate change says the West's high consumption of meat and dairy produce is fuelling global
                        warming.
                        But scientists and officials stopped short of explicitly calling on everyone to become vegan or
                        vegetarian.
                        They said that more people could be fed using less land if individuals cut down on eating meat.
                        The document, prepared by 107 scientists for the UN's <i>Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
                        (IPCC)</i>, says that if land is used more
                        effectively, it can store more of the carbon emitted by humans." A quarter of the global
                        emissions come from food production and more than half comes from the
                        production of animal products. </p>

                    <h2>Population growth </h2>
                    <p>The population is growing faster than it ever has. By the time you read this paragraph 250 babies
                        will be born!More people means more global emissions.
                        "A 2009 study of the relationship between population growth and global warming determined that
                        the “carbon legacy” of just one child can produce 20 times more greenhouse gas than a person
                        will save by driving a high-mileage car, recycling, using energy-efficient appliances and light
                        bulbs, etc. Each child born in the <i>United States</i> will add about 9,441 metric tons of carbon
                        dioxide to the carbon legacy of an average parent.Under current conditions, a child born & raised in the
                        <i>United States</i> will be responsible for almost seven times the carbon emissions of a child born & in
                        <i>China</i> and 168 times the impact of a child born in <i>Bangladesh</i>."</p>
